# üé© Dapper Dasher
Dapper Dasher is a 2D side-scrolling runner game inspired by the classic Google Dino Game ‚Äî but with more style, animations, and sound! Built in C++ using the raylib library, it‚Äôs a fun and fast-paced project showcasing animation handling, collision detection, and simple physics.

## üïπ Features
-> Animated main character (Scarfy) with smooth running and jumping <br>
-> Multiple obstacles (Nebulae) with animated sprites <br>
-> Parallax scrolling background layers for depth and immersion <br>
-> Gravity and jump physics for realistic motion <br>
-> Victory and loss conditions with replay options<br>
-> Integrated sound effects and background music<br>

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technical Highlights
-> Uses a custom AnimData struct to manage animations<br>
-> Frame-based update logic running at 60 FPS<br>
-> Efficient collision detection using rectangle overlap checks<br>
-> Randomized obstacle placement for varied runs<br>
-> Audio management with jump, victory, and loss sounds<br>
-> Clean resource management (textures, sounds, music)<br>

## üíæ How to Run
### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the repository:
```
